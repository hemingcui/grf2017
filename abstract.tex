\para{Improving the Reliability of Datacenter Computing via Fast, 
Scalable Distribute Consensus}

% \newline
\para{Abstract:}

% P1: More and more pplications are being run in datacenters with schedulers or 
% virtual machines. Many applications are mission critical. However, existing 
% schedulers or virtual machines did not provide satisfactory fault tolerence 
% to applications, causing big unavailable time window.
To deal with the rapidly increasing volume of data, more and more software
applications run in a datacenter with numerous computers. To harness the 
massive datacenter computing resources, applications are deployed with two major 
types of infrastructures, schedulers and virtual machines. These infrastructures 
have brought many benefits, including improving resource utlization, balancing 
loads, and saving energy. Unfortunately, as an application runs on more 
computers, minor computer failures will happen more likely and can turn down 
the entire application, causing severe disasters such as the NYSE Trading halts 
in 2015 and several Facebook outages in recent years.

% P2: This project aims to greatly improve the availability of datacenter 
% computing % with three objectives with a computer theory called state machine 
% replication. Introduce basic of the theory: replica, majority, consensus, 
% etc. 


% P3: First, build a fast, scalable SMR protocol. 
% Key challenge, scalability. We propose a new RDMA-based % protocol. Making 
% replicas agree on inputs on bare memory. Also, our protocol is general, cite 
% Crane.

% P4: Second, strength schedulers with this protocol. Challenge: ? Our approach?

% P5: Third, strenghten virtual machine with this protocol. Challenge: it is 
% difficult to enforce execute states efficiently at the same 
% time. We: hybrid replication. Or some other name. Fine-grained replication?

% P6: We envision that... impact, of the project.
