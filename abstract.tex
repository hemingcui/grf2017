\para{Greatly Improving the Reliability of Datacenter Computing via Fast, 
Scalable State Machine Replication}

% \newline
\para{Abstract:}

% P1: More and more pplications are being run in datacenters with schedulers or 
% virtual machines. Many applications are mission critical. However, existing 
% schedulers or virtual machines did not provide satisfactory fault tolerence 
% to applications, causing big unavailable time window.
Driven by the dramatically increasing computational demand, more and more 
real-world applications are being run in datacenter which consists of hundreds 
or thousands of computers.

% P2: This project aims to greatly improve the availability of datacenter 
% computing % with three objectives with a computer theory called state machine 
% replication. Introduce basic of the theory: replica, majority, consensus, 
% etc. 


% P3: First, build a fast, scalable SMR protocol. 
% Key challenge, scalability. We propose a new RDMA-based % protocol. Making 
% replicas agree on inputs on bare memory. Also, our protocol is general, cite 
% Crane.

% P4: Second, strength schedulers with this protocol. Challenge: ? Our approach?

% P5: Third, strenghten virtual machine with this protocol. Challenge: it is 
% difficult to enforce execute states efficiently at the same 
% time. We: hybrid replication. Or some other name. Fine-grained replication?

% P6: We envision that... impact, of the project.
